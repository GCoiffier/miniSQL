# Data Base & Data Mining
# Guillaume Coiffier, Nicolas Champseix
## ENS de Lyon 2018

## Requirements
- python 3
- ANTLR4 :
`wget http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.7-complete.jar`
`pip3 install antlr4-python3-runtime --user`

##Â Installing
In the makefile, set the variable ANTLR4 to the installation folder of ANTLR
`ANTLR4 = path/to/antlr/antlr-4.7-complete.jar`

## How to run
Simply type `make`
An interface will open, in which you can type commands.
Available commands :
- `.end `, `.exit` or `.quit` to quit
- `.run <request_file>.sql` to run command from a file
- A miniSQL query
/!\ All query files should be located in the 'request' folder, and all csv files should be located in the 'data' folder. Paths are computed relatively to these folders in the program.

example:
    `.run test.csv` to run the query file 'request/test.csv'

## Progress
- Full miniSQL syntax support
/!\ We have a really bad issue about performance with sub-request (request q3.sql takes about 5 seconds and q2.sql takes about 1 minute...)
The problem is the handling of those subqueries using join : since we have to recompute the subquery for every value of the main query, the complexity is a product of the sizes of the tables, that grows rapidely. (for q2, the obtained subquery is of size 10 000 000, and the projection on this relation takes a really long time)

## Technical choices
#### Relations
A relation in represented by a python object that has the following attribute
- a name <string>
- a set of entries (an entry is represented by a tuple)
- a dictionnary Attribute -> int, that tells us in which position in the tuple each field is

#### DataManager
The DataManager class handles every operation on tables, like loading, remaning, or accessing a table.
For now, every table is loaded into the memory.

#### Antlr and visitor pattern
For the lexer/parser of SQL queries, we used python's binding to ANTLR.
Given a .g4 file in which the grammar is described, ANTLR automatically generates a lexer, a parser and an empty visitor.
We then just had to implement the visitor.

## What remains to be done
- The whole 'A Better Algebra Engine' part of the project
- Optimisation of join
- Use of iterators on tables instead of loading everything in memory
- Possibility to output result of a query in a csv file
- Maybe some other fancy things
