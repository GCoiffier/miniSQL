# Data Base & Data Mining
# Guillaume Coiffier, Nicolas Champseix
## ENS de Lyon 2018

## Requirements
- python 3
- ANTLR4 :
`wget http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.7-complete.jar`
`pip3 install antlr4-python3-runtime --user`

##Â Installing
In the makefile, set the variable ANTLR4 to the installation folder of ANTLR
`ANTLR4 = path/to/antlr/antlr-4.7-complete.jar`

## How to run
Simply type `make`
An interface will open, in which you can type commands.
Available commands :
- `.end `, `.exit` or `.quit` to quit
- `.run <request_file>.sql` to run command from a file
- A miniSQL query
/!\ All query files should be located in the 'request' folder, and all csv files should be located in the 'data' folder. Paths are computed relatively to these folders in the program.

example:
    `.run test.csv` to run the query file 'request/test.csv'

The commandline handles history and autocompletion

## Progress
- SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE <simple Cond>
- SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... IN <subquery>
- SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... NOT IN <subquery>
- SELECT DISTINCT
- Subqueries in the FROM part
- GROUP BY and aggregation (MIN, MAX, COUNT, SUM)
- ORDER BY

/!\ We still have troubles with double nested queries (especially NOT IN ... NOT IN)

## Technical choices
#### Relations
A relation in represented by a python object that has the following attribute
- a name <string>
- a python iterator over the csv file
- a dictionnary Attribute -> int, that tells us in which position in the tuple each field is

relations are not loaded in memory, except after the application of
an ORDER BY or a GROUP BY operator

#### DataManager
The DataManager class handles every operation on tables, like creating a new one, remaning, or accessing a table.

#### Antlr and visitor pattern
For the lexer/parser of SQL queries, we used python's binding to ANTLR.
Given a .g4 file in which the grammar is described, ANTLR automatically generates a lexer, a parser and an empty visitor.
We then just had to implement the visitor.

## What remains to be done
- Possibility to output result of a query in a csv file
- Push Down Selects
